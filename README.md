# Conway's The Game of Life
This is a simulation that was created by John Conway in 1970. The simulation models the life cycle of individual “cells”, determining births and deaths for each subsequent generation using a set of fixed rules.

The game occurs on a two-dimensional grid, with either location either “alive” (filled) or “dead” (empty). The neighbors of a given cell consist of all eight surrounding locations (four that are vertically or horizontally adjacent, plus four that touch only the corners).
